##### Notes

> This code can be used as a reference for other Gatsby projects, but will not work out-of-the-box without replicating the data structure in Contentful.

#### If you would like to quickly bootstrap a Gatsby + Contentful + Netlify project, I recommend the fantastic [GCN](https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-starter-gcn) starter.
